# Prompt  
**Please schedule a meeting for next week using the link from the original interview email and have your solultion prepared 24 hours before the meeting so we can review your solution ahead of time. If you have any questions, concerns, or need anything at all please do not hesitate to contact tjpucket@ncsu.edu or mspinega@ncsu.edu** 

> This is not pass / fail Your program will be assessed for how you go about solving the problem.  
> Not completing the challenge is not an automatic disqualification.  
> This should be written in an Object Oriented mentality.  
> This program does not need a GUI and is acceptable as a command line / terminal application  
> This program should ensure only valid data can be given when prompting user for input.

## Overview

You are creating a program that emulates the real estate purchasing process.    
  
The user will input an annual income, and your program will return a maximum loan pre-approval quote.    
  
Once the user has a pre-approval quote the user should be prompted for their minimum requirements for their house: square footage, bed rooms, bathrooms.    
  
Once the requirements are gathered and approved, the user should be presented with a random number of listings.    
  
That fit their loan range and purchasing parameters. After the user chooses a home to purchase they will be given and overview of their loan and payment schedule.    
  

## Git Usage

To ensure a clear history of your development process, please follow these guidelines for using Git:
1. **Fork this repository**: Create a fork of this repo and grant read access to @mikahpinegar and @trevorjpuckett so we can review your commit history
2. **Main Branch**: Maintain a `main` branch that will serve as the primary branch for the project. This branch should contain your project's most stable and final version of the code.
3. **Feature Branches**: For each new feature or significant change, create a new branch from `main`. Name these branches with a prefix of `feature/` followed by a short descriptor of the feature (e.g., `feature/add-loan-calculation`).
4. **Bug Fix Branches**: If you need to fix a bug, create a branch with a prefix of `bugfix/` followed by a short descriptor of the bug fix (e.g., `bugfix/fix-input-validation`).
5. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. This helps in understanding the purpose of each change and makes the project history more readable.
6. **Pull Requests**: Once a feature or bug fix is complete, create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch back into `main`. Provide a brief description of the changes and any other relevant information for the review. Once a PR is ready, merge it into the main branch. There is no need for code review in this project.

Following these guidelines will help us understand your approach to solving the challenge and assess your skills in version control management.

### Gather Income data
First the user should be greeted, and prompted to give their annual income. 

### Generate Maximum Loan

Once the income is recieved the user should be given a maximum loan amount.  
The maximum loan amount is generated by ensuring ***the loan will be paid off in exactly 30 years***.  
***The loan's maximum monthly payment will be 1/3 of the users monthly income.***
* 50% of the monthly payment will be used to pay down the loan amount.
* 30% of the monthly payment will be taken as interest.
* 20% of the monthly payment will be used to pay the taxes and insurance.

### Loan restrictions
> A loan cannot be less than $50,000  

When calculating the users maximum loan,  
you should not grant the user a loan if the calculated maximum loan is less than $50,000

### Gather buyers requirements
Once the user has recieved a loan pre-approval quote (maximum loan amount), the user should be prompted for the following:  
* How much square footage are they looking for?
* How many bedrooms?
* How many bathrooms?

### Generate House Listings
Once the user has entered in that information, the user should be given back a list of houses that match their descriptions within their loan amount.
The list should show each houses purchase price, square footage, price per square feet, bedroom & bathroom count.

#### Listings Restrictions
> There are restrictions to what should return results  

* A house cannot have less that 250 square feet.
* A house cannot have a price less than $50,000.
* The square footage of a house cannot be more than 1.25% of the houses price.
* A house cannot have more than 1 bedroom per 400 square feet.
* A house cannot have more than 1 bathroom per room.

#### Listings Specifications

> Each house should have custom generated values.  

When generating a list of houses, there should be some where between 2 and 12 options  
unless the users requirements cause any of the restrictions to be true.  

When generating a list of houses the purchase price generated should be marked up or discounted  
depending on the number of houses in the list up to a maximum of 10%.  
For example:  
* a list of 2 houses means that the price of each house should be marked up by 10%.
* a list of 7 houses means that the price of each house should be marked up by 0%.
* a list of 12 houses means that the price of each house should be discounted by 10%.


### Purchase a property
> Keep in mind that the purchase price will most likely not be the maximum loan amount.
> but the mortgage should still take exactly 30 years to be paid off.

The user should be able to select a house from the list to purchase or generate a new list. 

### Generate Bill Breakdown
Once a user selects a property, they should be given a break down of their monthly bill & amounts paid over the lifetime of the mortgage.  
This should display the following information:  

#### Loan lifetime information 
* Total amount paid over the lifetime of the mortgage.
* Amount paid on the balance over the lifetime of the mortgage.
* Amount of interest paid over the lifetime of the mortgage.
* Amount of taxes & insurance paid over the lifetime of the mortgage.

#### Loan monthly information
* Total monthly payment.
* Amount being applied to balance each month.
* Amount of interest paid each month.
* Amount of taxes & insurance paid each month.
